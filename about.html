                <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
            <p>mI my name is<strong>Julissa Elena Tenas</strong> I am Latina CS student, medical assistant, administerative assistant,
                        and a support specialist. I spend most of here time at the University of Rhode Island pursuing a bachelors degree in Computer Science or in my hometown Providence,
                        Rhode Island. I have had the oppurtunity to work as cashier and as akickboxing assistant. I am currently working as a medical and administrative
                        assistant, and as a support specialist at Jenks Park Pediatrics.
                        </p>
                <p> Besides my work life, I enjoy being active. Basketball, soccer, and volleybal are prefered sports to play. Spending my time outdoors is very relaxing for me.
                        Especially when taking a trip to the beach her in Rhode Island. Rhode island is my home town where I grew up playing out side all four seasons. Other than the great
                        outdoors, I do love staying inside my cozy home. There is nothing like baking a warm batch of cookies or slowlying cooking a pork shoulder in the oven. As you can already
                        tell, I love to cook and bake as well.
