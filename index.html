    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>

<p>Hi, my name is Julissa Tenas. I am a first year student at the University of Rhode Island majoring in Computer Science. I was born and raised in Providence, RI. I am thrilled to start coding!
         This web site is going to be a portfolio for myself. I plan to uses this website as a resume for future jobs that could offer experience in coding. My main idea for this website, is to
        show individuality as a student to a professor or employer. Please read the about me page for a peek of what my website will contain.</p>
